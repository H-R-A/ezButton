## What is it?

This is a small and (very) simple variant of the library ezButton provided by ArduinoGetStarted.com.

## Why would I do it?

I was working on a project with a very long code, and due to a conflict in the different libraries used, the function millis() was causing problems for usage in the code.
As I had simmilar issues before and new that a change to now() solved the problem, I did the same approach for the ezButton library.
